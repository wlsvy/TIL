# Mastering Vim, Ruslan Osipov, 2ND Edition

## A brief history lesson

> Before personal computers and terminals, there were teleprinters. A teleprinter is a mechanical typewriter that can send and receive messages over a telecommunications channel.
>
> As technology progressed, teleprinters were replaced by terminals with screens, which enabled much more robust text editing. Vim’s direct predecessor, **vi**, started its life all the way back in 1976. Unlike its predecessors, **vi** (developed by Bill Joy, the author of ex) included many quality-of-life features and even allowed you to edit multiple lines of text at once – what a luxury!
