## The C# Compiler

The C# compiler turns *.cs files into a *.dll file, aka an assembly file. An assembly file is a portable executable format which .NET Core can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. A “.NET Core app” is really just a collection of the *.dll files (and a few config files.) It can be produced using multiple programming languages like VB or F#, but C# is most commonly used.

```cs
/* Program.cs */
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
        => System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
}
```
위의 코드를 컴파일하고 실행해본다고 할 때

```console
> dotnet \
  /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.3/Roslyn/bincore/csc.dll \
  -reference:/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder/microsoft.netcore.app/2.0.0/ref/netcoreapp2.0/System.Runtime.dll \
  -reference:/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder/microsoft.netcore.app/2.0.0/ref/netcoreapp2.0/System.Console.dll \
  -out:Program.dll \
  Program.cs
  ```

Explaining the arguments:

- dotnet - the C# compiler is itself a .NET Core application, so we must launch it by using dotnet.
/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.3/Roslyn/bincore/csc.dll - the path to the C# compiler. This is found in C:\Program Files\dotnet\ on Windows.
- -reference args pointing to System.Runtime.dll and System.Console.dll - these are like “header” files. They provide the compiler with information about “System.Object” and “System.Console”.
- -out:Program.dll - the output file name. The .dll extension is a .NET Core convention, not a requirement. If not specified, the compiler will produce a file named Program.exe. On Windows, this would be a little misleading becase you can’t double-click Program.exe, so in .NET Core we always use .dll.
- Program.cs - the path to your C# file

## runtimeconfig.json

The runtimeconfig.json file is required for .NET Core applications. The terms “runtime”, “shared framework”, or “platform” are often used interchangeably, but they typically mean the same thing when talking about .NET Core. This JSON file configures options for the runtime.

```console
{
  "runtimeOptions": {
    "framework": {
      "name": "Microsoft.NETCore.App",
      "version": "2.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```
.NET Core 가 Program.dll 파일을 실행하기 위해서는 위와 같은 `Program.runtimeconfig.json` 컨텐츠가 필요하다. 여기서는 닷넷이 Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.0 shared framework 가 필요하다고 알려주고 있다. 닷넷은 이 Json 파일을 확인하고는 `/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/$FrameworkName/$Version/` 경로에서 요구되는 파일이 있는지 확인한다.

## Packages

Packages provide a way to share code between projects, teams, and organizations. .NET assemblies are bundled into *.nupkg files, which are just ZIP archive files with an XML file (.nuspec) that contains metadata about the package.

패키지는 작성된 코드를 조직/팀/프로젝트 사이에서 공유할 수 있도록 수단을 제공합니다.

## Dynamic Linking

- [원문](https://natemcmaster.com/blog/2017/12/21/netcore-primitives/#dynamic-linking)

.NET is a dynamically linked runtime. 

## deps.json

The deps.json file is a dependencies manifest. It can be used to configure dynamic linking to assemblies that come from packages. As mentioned above, .NET Core can be configured to dynamically load assemblies from multiple locations. These locations include:

- App base directory (in the same folder as the entry point application, no config required)
- Package cache folders (NuGet restore cache or NuGet fallback folders)
- An optimized package cache or runtime packages store
- The servicing index (rarely used. For Windows Update purposes.)
- Shared framework (configured via runtimeconfig.json)

Among other things, the deps.json file defines a list of dependencies that can be dynamically linked. Normally, this file is machine-generated, and can get really big and complicated for a real-world app. But, it’s plaintext, so we can craft it with just an editor.
